## Components

### Notes

- Whereever the current categories can't handle the information, the notes category would get created and information written into the same. 

### tags

- On top tags should be placed which will help in multiple things like searching the content, from top itself knowing the breadth it covers, is it relevant or not. So along with the directory hierarchy, tags would be useful to understand the contextual position of the document without knowing about the content of the document.

### References

- for each note making the reference of the website from where I am studying would be such a great thing. As it would make the it easy for anyone to traverse the same. 

### TL;DR

too long; didn't read this at the top of the document can define what it covers, what it doesn't and such, a summary also
