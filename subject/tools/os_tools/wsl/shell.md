# Shell
An interface that allows users to interact with an operating system by interpreting commands and executing them. It acts as a bridge between the human user and the system's core (the kernel), accepting human-readable instructions and translating them into actions the computer can understand. Shells can be command-line interfaces (CLIs) for typing commands or graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for point-and-click interaction.
