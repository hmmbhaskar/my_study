## Bash Keyboard Shortcuts (Emacs Settings)



## How to

### Change terminal editor mode

- By default bash terminal runs in Emacs settings, leading to the keybindings and shortcuts same like Emacs editor. If one wants, can switch to the Vi shortcuts instead
  - Set vi mode in bash:
    - set -o vi
  - Set Emacs Mode in bash:
    - set -o emacs

## Interesting Bit

### Why Bash shortcuts are like emacs editor shortcut?

> Because Bash's command-line editing is handled by the GNU Readline library, created by Brian Fox, who was also an Emacs hacker.
