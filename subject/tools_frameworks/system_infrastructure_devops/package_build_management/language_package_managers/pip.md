## Interesting

- Full form of pip is "Pip Installs Packages". Quite interesting and unique name.  

## Notes

- pip ins't inherently part of python. pip is an independent project with its own release cycle, and the latest available stable version is bundled with maintenance and feature releases of the CPython reference interpreter. The ensurepip package provides support for bootstrapping the pip installer into an existing Python installation or virtual environment.
