# Daily report

## 2025/10/01

1. Started from Mid day like 1 Pm, as today is the first day when unallocated
2. Configured wsl like understood that the default terminal emulator of Ubuntu in case of WSL isn't GNOME but instead of zutty, not much information on the same were available online. But finding the official website was helpful to understand.
3. Understood the difference between multiple things like one being Terminal vs Terminal Emulator, Shell vs CLI, sudo apt vs sudo snap
4. Understood multiple things of daily operations like shortcuts to use window terminal, vs code and such for smooth operation. Like creating new terminal using the command pallet of the terminal.
5. Found one unique finding that typing bash in cmd will lead to starting of the WSL, but doing the same in the git-bash terminal would lead to nothing as the git-bash terminal is itself a bash and the bash.exe binary in the git directory might be getting priority referenced instead of the bash from wsl.
6. Understood that using one terminal lets say git-bash we can work across many shell like to cmd, powershell, bash(wsl). As just enter the mode wanted like "wsl" or "powershell" or "cmd" and then when done just enter exit to logout from the recent mode. Let's say once you enter the powershell and then from powershell prompt you enter the cmd then exit button at first would just exit the cmd and then again exit would exit the powershell. Kind of nested shell session.
7. Wasn't able to open the git-bash in the same window of the cmd.
8. Learnt multiple ways to open file in default program from git-bash and ubuntu
