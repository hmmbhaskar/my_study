## Date Wise

I am recording whatever reflections I might get while studying for continuously

1. It's weird that trying to develop some content using the llm and then trying to use llm to evaluate and suggest improvements is an unending loop as llm would keep suggestion improvements which would seems logical as per explanation but in the next new session of chat if asked again to evaluate they can suggest to go back or do somewhat reverse of what is there, so no common consensus is easy to arrive and no directly path of improvements towards best version.  
2. Claude Sonnet 4.5 Reasoning model's (Extended Thinking mode) limit is extremely low, like really low, just 3 messages in a week, even Deep Research of ChatGPT which takes sometimes half an hour is having more limit than that. Not having much money to buy premium hence using multiple accounts of claude as workaround. But with my another space account, with which I might have tried earlier, the onboarding form comes asking for phone number, the same doesn't happen any more with opening new account using Google sign in.

1. What is the use of note making, especially of how to and things which can come handy later? As easier than searching notes for something would be just ask local or online LLM and it would be able to give the exact steps in fact perfect steps to achieve the same. But still as heard that keeping notes is for the person learning, so creating notes for the self future to revise easily.
2. One great reason can be for note making is to have a clear picture of what to study as without clear progression, how would one know even what to ask, what to learn, what to study, and just asking any llm would give a lot topic and many things which might be either too overwhelming and having lots and lots of topics or missing a lot of things really required in studying. And that's why I would be making notes.
