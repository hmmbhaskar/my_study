I am recording whatever reflections I might get while studying for continously

1. What is the use of note making, espeically of how to and things which can come handy later? As eaiser than searching notes for something would be just ask local or online LLM and it would be able to give the exact steps infact perfect steps to achive the same. But still as heard that keeping notes is for the person learning, so creating notes for the self future to revise easily.
2. One great reason can be for note making is to have a clear picture of what to study as without clear progression, how would one know even what to ask, what to learn, what to study, and just asking any llm would give a lot topic and many things which might be either too overwheling and having lots and lots of topics or missing a lot of things really required in studying. And that's why I would be making notes.
