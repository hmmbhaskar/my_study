## Time Leaks

1. Gym
   1. Time: ~ 2 Hours
   2. Note: Essential, have accumulated too much fat. 10 kg extra weight then I should be.
2. Office
   1. Time: ~ 8 Hours
   2. Note: Office is also learning only but it is task and requirement specific, not directly towards the ovearall my Jan goal hence getting considered leak. I am greatful for the work as the ultimate objective of the learning is to create value for the world. Will try to utlilize time spare in office work for the Educational purpose, since two years have been very high working employee, even on weekends did office works, but this time I need to extract spare time otherwise would be lost extremely behind in the fronteir such fast paced world towards AGI.
3. Planned Weekend Tours
   1. Time: ~ 48 hours
   2. Note: Possibly because of preparation, tiredness and multiple other factors, Can't save from the weekend. And weekend tour is essential because even after being 2 and half year is Kerala, I haven't been able to visit great tourist places of the Kerala. In next 2-3 months might need to Leave Kerala, and if would have to leave without visiting great places, it would be forever regret.
